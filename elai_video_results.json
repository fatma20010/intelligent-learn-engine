Nothing herein shall constitute or be construed or considered to be a limitation upon or which are specifically reserved. Two main factors may explain recent increase in gold purchases by central banks. First, gold is viewed as a safe haven and desirable asset during times of economic, financial, and geopolitical uncertainty as well as a portfolio diversifier. Second, gold is seen as a safe asset when countries are subject to financial sanctions and asset freezes. Skeptics, however, point to drawbacks in reliance on gold, including its cost to transport, warehouse, and secure and its lack of interest. Despite these disadvantages, gold remains a popular asset for central banks due to its historical track record and the well-regulated markets for trading. The available empirical evidence suggests that some reserve managers respond to relative costs and returns by increasing the share of gold in their reserves when the expected return on financial Now let's look at some key points. mine supply 75% 3,482 tonnes Recycled gold 25% 1,172 tonnes Total supply 4,653 tonnes Mined Recycled Because gold has multiple sources of demand and supply as compared to other major asset classes, its liquidity is less likely to dry up during times of market volatility. A large fraction of the demand comes from the physical side, as gold is actively used to produce jewelry and technology as well as being bought physically by central banks; taken together, Central banks are significant players in the gold market, holding large reserves of gold as a store of value and a hedge against In conclusion, reserve managers consider gold to be a means of protecting against economic and geopolitical risks, and they therefore tend to increase their gold holdings during times of uncertainty or high geopolitical risk. Additionally, reserve managers in emerging markets tend to increase their gold holdings when there is a risk of financial sanctions. The largest increases in gold holdings by central banks often occur when the banks anticipate or face financial sanctions. The study’s econometric analysis revealed that both the volume and the value of gold reserves tend to rise in response to sanctions imposed by major economies such as the Thank you for watching this chapter."

In their research, Baur and Smales (2018, 2020) make a distinction between expected or perceived geopolitical risk and actual or realized geopolitical risk, and conclude that the former is more significant in determining gold prices. Central banks hold their reserves in a variety of assets, including fixed-income products (such as government bonds), deposits with commercial banks or money market instruments, currency deposits with other central banks or multilateral organizations (such as the Bank for International Settlements or the International Monetary Fund), Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) with the IMF, and gold. Around 85 percent of their currency reserves are held in US dollars, euros, or British pounds (IMF COFER 2022Q3). This means that they may not be able to access these reserves if there are problems with these currencies. Gold differs from other central bank assets in that it can be stored in the home country and is insulated from geopolitical risks. However, gold stored locally can only be exchanged for domestic currency or used to settle obligations with countries that accept it as payment. It cannot be used as collateral for swaps and loans. Although geopolitical risks are likely to strengthen gold’s role as a reserve asset, Now let's look at some key points. gold. Among the eligible investment options, gold was more commonly allowed than inflation-indexed bonds, which were permitted by only 50 percent of the respondents. Additionally, almost all of the central banks surveyed were eligible to invest in bonds, bank deposits, SSA securities, and money market instruments, On average, respondents allocated 8 percent of their portfolios to gold. It is worth noting that although 60 percent of central banks hold gold in their reserve portfolios, only 20 II. \u0007GOVERNANCE AND bank reserve portfolios is usually not determined based on considerations of risk and return or correlations with other asset classes. In In conclusion, allocation in a portfolio is 10 percent, which, when combined with a 30/70 equity-bond mix, results in a 3.3 percent downside volatility. This “gilded mix” has lower negative volatility than a 30/70 equity- bond combination with bonds. A 10 percent gold allocation to a fixed equity-bond portfolio reduces downside volatility by 0.3 percentage points, or 10 percent. Except for exceptionally stock-heavy portfolios, when the proportional reduction in downside volatility is approximately 15 percent, this conclusion holds over the whole range of stock-bond ratios. As a result, gold has the potential to be a useful capital preservation asset in a portfolio. Thank you for watching this chapter."

According to the general economic theory, frictionless and well-functioning markets tend to produce efficient outcomes that benefit consumers (Varian 1992). This is facilitated by features such as low transaction costs, immediacy in execution, and the ability to execute large transactions without significantly impacting prices. The Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS 2014) defines market liquidity as the ability to execute large transactions quickly with minimal price impact, meaning that recent transactions should not have a significant effect on the overall market price in deep and liquid markets.

One reason as a store of value or medium of exchange, it also has various industrial and technological applications, ensuring that its value does not depend solely on its use as a store of value.

The addition of gold to the base portfolio would have resulted in a deterioration in most of the performance metrics aside from Sortino and diversification ratio, and the percent of the positive return periods. The portfolios with higher gold allocations experienced larger losses and higher volatility. Risk-adjusted measures such as the Sharpe ratio and Sortino ratio also worsened with higher gold allocations.

    "script": "Welcome to Chapter 5: TRADING. As a trading commodity, gold can be traded through various channels, including exchanges, physical dealers, and over-the-counter (OTC) markets. On exchanges such as the COMEX and the Shanghai Gold Exchange (SGE), gold futures contracts and spot contracts are traded by investors and industry players. Physical dealers, such as jewelry shops and bullion dealers, offer physical gold in the form of bars, coins, and jewelry for purchase by retail customers. OTC markets, on the other hand, are decentralized and allow for customized transactions between buyers and sellers, with prices negotiated based on current market conditions. In the London OTC market, the largest gold market by volume, gold is traded via bilateral agreements with bullion banks for Loco London Unallocated gold (Loco London refers to gold bullion that is physically held in London vaults to underpin the trading activity in this market). Spot trades are typically priced in USD/oz on a T+2 settlement basis. This price is commonly used as a benchmark for the gold price and gold prices in other markets, which are typically quoted on a discount/premium over the Loco London gold spot price.

For example, on March 31, 2023, the LBMA PM Fixing for gold was 1979.70 USD/oz. If the central bank wants to hedge its downside, it can buy a put option at the closing price of 22.40 USD/oz per troy ounce of gold. This means that the total cost of the put option to hedge the position on 10,000 oz will be US$224,000 (10,000*$22.40). Several option strategies, such as zero cost collars, barrier options, binary options, and others, involve combining a long/short position in puts/calls and lowering the cost of hedging by changing the risk profile.

    "script": "Welcome to Chapter 6: BUYING GOLD THROUGH LOCAL PRODUCTION. Purchases of local gold production have a distinct advantage in that, because the gold is purchased for the local currency, the procedure can help build up foreign reserves. Central banks can set up local gold buying programs in several ways. The most common procedure is to give the country’s central bank a “priority right” or “right of first refusal” to purchase local production. (Some countries like Ethiopia, Ghana, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Türkiye, and Uzbekistan use this approach.) An alternative method is for the central bank to set up a special gold buying program or form direct agreements to purchase the metal from local artisanal and small-scale miners (e.g., the ASGM program) or commercial banks (as in Bolivia, Ecuador, Mongolia, the Philippines, the Russian Federation, and Zambia). The central banks publish the official gold purchase prices and usually include a discount for logistics costs, trading (bid-ask spread), and quality, if the metal is not of LGD standard. Since most locally produced gold comes in nonstandardized form, the central banks engage in quality swap programs to upgrade their holdings to LGD standard. This is accomplished with the help of LGD refiners, with both the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and bullion Now let's look at some key points.

Physical gold is transported and insured in accordance with the international terms of sale (Incoterms) agreed upon In conclusion, have a positive environmental impact. Furthermore, there is no internationally accepted method for assessing the carbon footprint of gold. Gold mining is known to have a significant impact on anthropogenic climate change due to the use of fossil fuels, primarily diesel, resulting in considerable greenhouse gas emissions (Mudd 2007). Various studies have confirmed that the greenhouse gas emission (GHG) intensity associated with gold production is substantially higher compared to that of other metals (Baur and Oll 2019). However, when considering global production on an aggregate level, gold proves to be more environmentally friendly than other metals.

    "script": "Welcome to Chapter 7: GOLD. This is due to its greater value and lower annual mining output in comparison to metals such as silver, copper, iron ore, and aluminum (Hagelüken and Meskers 2010). Additionally, compared to other nonrenewable resources, gold possesses the quality of durability to a unique degree. The gold industry’s annual carbon footprint is roughly 0.3 percent of global emissions (World Gold Council 2022). Some empirical estimates put the median level of GHG associated with the extraction of one metric tonne of gold at 20.3 tons (Ghia, Lindeman, and Zhang 2021), 16.9 tons (Hagelüken and Meskers 2010), 17.6 tons (Norgate and Haque 2012), and 15.4 tons (Baur and Oll 2019). The estimates show that gold holdings lead to 36 percent less CO2 emissions than S&P500 holdings (Baur and Oll 2019). According to Baur and Oll (2019), adding gold to a diversified equity portfolio not only improves the risk-return relationship but also contributes to the portfolio’s sustainability by reducing carbon emissions over time. This applies to both the S&P500 and carbon-efficient versions of it. Even if carbon emissions are attributed to physical gold holdings, the impact on carbon performance is positive, since emissions from companies are continuous, while gold mining is a one-time event Now let's look at some key points. gold allocations have a significant impact on an overall portfolio’s carbon footprint and emissions intensity. A 10 percent gold allocation (along with corresponding reductions in other asset holdings) reduced the emissions intensity of a portfolio of 70 percent equities and 30 percent bonds by 7 percent; a 20 percent gold carbon footprint and emissions intensity of the market value of the overall portfolio.

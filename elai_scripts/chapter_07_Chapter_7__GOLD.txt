Welcome to Chapter 7: GOLD. This is due to its greater value and lower annual mining output in comparison to metals such as silver, copper, iron ore, and aluminum (Hagelüken and Meskers 2010). Additionally, compared to other nonrenewable resources, gold possesses the quality of durability to a unique degree. The gold industry’s annual carbon footprint is roughly 0.3 percent of global emissions (World Gold Council 2022). Some empirical estimates put the median level of GHG associated with the extraction of one metric tonne of gold at 20.3 tons (Ghia, Lindeman, and Zhang 2021), 16.9 tons (Hagelüken and Meskers 2010), 17.6 tons (Norgate and Haque 2012), and 15.4 tons (Baur and Oll 2019). The estimates show that gold holdings lead to 36 percent less CO2 emissions than S&P500 holdings (Baur and Oll 2019). According to Baur and Oll (2019), adding gold to a diversified equity portfolio not only improves the risk-return relationship but also contributes to the portfolio’s sustainability by reducing carbon emissions over time. This applies to both the S&P500 and carbon-efficient versions of it. Even if carbon emissions are attributed to physical gold holdings, the impact on carbon performance is positive, since emissions from companies are continuous, while gold mining is a one-time event Now let's look at some key points. gold allocations have a significant impact on an overall portfolio’s carbon footprint and emissions intensity. A 10 percent gold allocation (along with corresponding reductions in other asset holdings) reduced the emissions intensity of a portfolio of 70 percent equities and 30 percent bonds by 7 percent; a 20 percent gold carbon footprint and emissions intensity of the market value of the overall portfolio. A long- term perspective is also required to determine how portfolio holdings of gold will contribute to long-term climate scenarios and targets.

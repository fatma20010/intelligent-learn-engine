Welcome to Chapter 4: was backtested using the historical asset returns for Q1 2000 to Q1 2023, with the particular. interest paid to how the respective portfolios would have performed during some of the crises that occurred during this period. The addition of gold to the base portfolio would have resulted in a deterioration in most of the performance metrics aside from Sortino and diversification ratio, and the percent of the positive return periods. The portfolios with higher gold allocations experienced larger losses and higher volatility. Risk-adjusted measures such as the Sharpe ratio and Sortino ratio also worsened with higher gold allocations. While gold improved diversification to some extent, conditional VaR (CVaR) values are a clear indication that a central bank primarily concerned with safety irrespective of returns should be cautious when adding gold into the asset mix. Asset Gold Allocation US Treasuries Metric Portfolio 1 Portfolio 1 (10% gold) Portfolio 1 (20% gold) Annualized return -3.9% -7.7% -11.5% Annualized standard deviation Max. drawdown -5.5% -6.6% -7.7% Sharpe ratio -1.19% -1.91 -2.32 Downside volatility 0.82% 0.84% 0.88% Sortino ratio -0.33 -0.30 -0.26 Diversification ratio Historical value-at-risk (5%) -1.7% -1.9% -2.3% Conditional value-at-risk (5%) -2.7% -2.7% -3.0% Positive periods It is important to note that it is not appropriate to make decisions when the risk-adjusted metrics such as Sharpe ratio are Now let's look at some key points. also exhibit mixed outcomes, with the 10 percent gold allocation showing a slightly better Sharpe and Sortino ratio. The diversification ratio improves with higher gold allocations, suggesting increased diversification benefits.

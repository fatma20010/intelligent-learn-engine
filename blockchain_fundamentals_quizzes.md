Blockchain is always controlled by a single central authority.  

**Q2. (Multiple Choice)**  
Which of the following is NOT a property of blockchain?  
A) Decentralization  
B) Immutability  
C) Transparency  
D) Centralized governance  

**Q3. (Scenario-Based)**  
You’re explaining blockchain to a 10-year-old. They ask, “If someone changes one block, can they change history?” How do you answer, considering block structure and consensus mechanisms?  

**Answers:**  
1. False  
2. D) Centralized governance  
3. Changing one block would require altering all following blocks and gaining majority control of the network, which is practically impossible in large blockchains.

## Chapter 2: Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)

**Q1. (True/False)**  
A distributed ledger always requires internet access for all participants to function.  

**Q2. (Multiple Choice)**  
Which statement about permissioned vs. permissionless ledgers is correct?  
A) Permissionless ledgers require approval to join.  
B) Permissioned ledgers allow anyone to participate without approval.  
C) Permissionless ledgers are open to everyone, while permissioned ledgers restrict access.  
D) Both require government approval.  

**Q3. (Scenario-Based)**  
A bank is considering using a distributed ledger for interbank settlements. Which type (permissioned or permissionless) would you recommend and why?  

**Answers:**  
1. False  
2. C) Permissionless ledgers are open to everyone, while permissioned ledgers restrict access.  
3. A permissioned ledger is better as it allows controlled participation and compliance with regulations.

## Chapter 3: Cryptography in Blockchain

**Q1. (True/False)**  
A hash function in blockchain can be reversed to retrieve the original data.  

**Q2. (Multiple Choice)**  
What is the primary function of a public key?  
A) Store cryptocurrency securely offline  
B) Identify the sender in a transaction  
C) Receive funds on the blockchain  
D) Encrypt the blockchain’s code  

**Q3. (Scenario-Based)**  
You receive a file claiming to contain transaction details. How could you verify that it hasn’t been tampered with using hashing?  

**Answers:**  
1. False  
2. C) Receive funds on the blockchain  
3. You could generate the file’s hash and compare it to the original recorded hash. If they match, the file is intact.

**Q2. (Multiple Choice)**  
Which of these is an off-chain computation example?  
A) Mining a Bitcoin block  
B) Verifying a smart contract on Ethereum  
C) Running heavy computations on an external server, then recording the result on-chain  
D) Hashing transactions on the blockchain  

**Q3. (Scenario-Based)**  
A healthcare DApp must prove a patient meets certain criteria without revealing medical details. Which cryptographic method should it use?  

**Answers:**  
1. True  
2. C) Running heavy computations on an external server, then recording the result on-chain  
3. Zero-knowledge proofs

An investor wants to store Bitcoin long-term with maximum security. Which storage method should you recommend and why?  

**Answers:**  
1. False  
2. D) All of the above  
3. A cold wallet because it stores keys offline, reducing hacking risk.
